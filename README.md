# branch

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ddavison/branch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ddavison/branch)

A utility that lets you branch 1 file to multiple directories.

The standard paradigm for copying files has always been "copy multiple files to 1 directory".

I aim to change that with this tool.


On several occasions, I've noticed myself needing to copy one file into mulitple directories, but no easy solution of doing so.  Even using explorer it's difficult to do.

### usage
```branch file directories...```  
Branch {file} into {directories} (you may specify more than one)

```branch [-h|--help]```  
Output the usage in the terminal

```branch -v|--version```  
Output the version in the terminal
